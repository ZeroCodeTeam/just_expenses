# FAQ

## How can I delete my data?

The app lets you **manually record and manage your income and expenses**.  
This financial data is stored **only on your device** in a local database.  
We **do not upload or store your data on any server** — it remains completely private and under your control.

If you wish to delete this data, you have the following options:

### Option 1: Clear App Data via Device Settings

1. Open your phone's **Settings**.
2. Go to **Apps** (or **Applications**).
3. Find and tap the name of our app.
4. Tap **Storage & cache** (or similar).
5. Choose **Clear Storage** or **Clear Data**.

This completely erases the app’s local database, removing all your financial entries.

### Option 2: Uninstall the App

Uninstalling the app will also delete all associated data, including any finance records stored on your device.
